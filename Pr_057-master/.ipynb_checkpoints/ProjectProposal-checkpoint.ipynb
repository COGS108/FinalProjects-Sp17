    "In general gentrification is a term for the arrival of wealthier people in an existing urban district, a related increase in rents and property values, and changes in the district's character and culture. The term is often used negatively, suggesting the displacement of poor communities by rich outsiders. The effects of gentrification are complex and oftentimes contradictory, and its real impact varies. People have many thoughts on the true and lasting effects gentrification has on particular areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gentrification is commonly disputed due to varied perspectives towards the effects on the communities touched by the process. In an attempt to make neighborhoods more “middle-class,” some believe that gentrification disproportionately targets underrepresented and low income families. Critics claim that gentrification (often forcefully) pushes these marginalized groups to less-privileged and oftentimes under-resourced areas, while catering to an influx of wealthy (ie white) populations. On the other hand, those in favor of gentrification believe that the process tends to decrease crime, while adding diversity to neighborhoods that may be predominantly one race or ethnicity. This topic is one that is definitely widely contested. It still continues to affect many communities in the US today.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s age, areas within the US are oftentimes sectioned off into 3 tracts: gentrified, non-gentrified, and ineligible to be gentrified. A tract is eligible to gentrify if its median household income and median home value are both in the bottom 40th percentile of all tracts within a metro area at the beginning of the decade.\n",

These data sets are commonly found in the form of CSV or JSON; however, for data contained in excel spreadsheets, we will convert the files into CSV files.

    "\n",
    "First we will start by actually identifying these gentrified neighborhoods. We will perform this classification by separating the populations present in San Diego county into different categories. These categories will include home value, housing income, and racial diversity within each city. Once we have identified the gentrified neighborhoods present, we will then begin to look at the crime rates associated with these areas. We will look at the crime rates present both pre- and post-gentrification, and then compare this to the overall (city-wide) crime-rates within that same time frame. With these two data sets, we will determine whether or not a particular neighborhood’s decrease in crime directly correlated to a decrease in city-wide crime as well. These patterns of crime rate over time will be used to determine if gentrification favors the idea that crime in these areas are truly eliminated, or instead simply removed and uprooted to other areas within San Diego.\n",

In order to examine that, we will identify the mean, median, and mode to determine the L2 errors (mean squared error) and L1 errors as well as resampling. By simply plotting the data and visualizing the data, we will be able to see certain trends and possible outliers. This methodology will allow us to sift through the large amounts of data present and isolate the points/factors that are relevant to our particular research question.\n",

    "In the data collected, pitfalls may include misinterpretation regarding rates in crime. Crime falls into multiple categories like theft, assault, sex crimes, and drug/alcohol violations. Within a neighborhood undergoing gentrification, it is possible that violent crimes may decrease while the the number of theft increases. This discrepancy in crime counts may skew the data in a way that does not clearly reflect the community’s overall perceived sense of safety. Moreover, the results derived from the data is limited to only suggesting a trend based on crime and socioeconomic determinants; thus, it is not possible to conclude the direct effects of gentrification. Aside from crime rates, additional data sets to look at include economic diversity, food insecurity, and poverty level.\n",

    "Given more time, grids could be artificially drawn out within the geography of San Diego in order to map out the movement of populations between regions. To gain more insights on resident migration, comparisons may be drawn from age,  job, and education level. Creating a geospatial visualization to track these movements would further reveal other trends that may not be as easily seen on a simple line or bar graph.\n"
